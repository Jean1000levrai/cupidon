___________from jean to isidore___________
---------during week end--------------
- rearranged the code
- added 8 pictures for monde2 (img/decor/monde2/...)
- created 2 new functions (doesn't work yet) : "monde1" and "monde2" to load the different worlds

------------- june 3rd-------------
- added a new boss "frost" that works with 11 functions line 712 to 903:
    - BUG!!!! : - it cant die yet 
                - its health bar doesnt appear
                - dunno why tho but too lazy to do it now
- added a new world "monde2" (a kind of frozen area)to the game currently inaccessible to the player: (function "monde1" and "monde2")
    - switch side works
    - the mobs are still there
    - calls the boss "frost" when score is greater than 10
- global variable : 
    - monde = 1 # 1 or 2
    - boss_frost = []
    - frost_hp = 4
- lists for images :
    - img_boss_frost = [[],[]] 
    - img_frost_health = []
    - img_bg_monde2 = [[],[]]
        # to do every different images
        list[0].extend(charger_image('path', nb of images to load, (tuple for the size)))
